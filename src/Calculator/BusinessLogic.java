/**
 * <p> Title: BusinessLogic Class. </p>
 * 
 * <p> Description: The code responsible for performing the calculator business logic functions. 
 * This method deals with CalculatorValues and performs actions on them.  The class expects data
 * from the User Interface to arrive as Strings and returns Strings to it.  This class calls the
 * CalculatorValue class to do computations and this class knows nothing about the actual 
 * representation of CalculatorValues, that is the responsibility of the CalculatorValue class and
 * the classes it calls.</p>

 * 
 * @version 4.01	2019-01-29 Added the Subtraction, Multiplication and Division method to perform the Calculations.
 * @version 4.02    2019-02-19 Aman added the Logarithmic method to calculate the log
 *                             Jatin added the condition to test the different value of the text field.
 * @version 4.03    2019-03-20 No changes made in this class for this version.
 * 
 * @version 4.04    2019-04-06 Constructor had been changed so that it accept the error term also.
 * 							   Methods have also been changed so that they can accept the error term
 * 
 * @version 4.05    2019-09-29 Methods and constructors are changed to accept the values of UNumber.
 * 
 * @version 4.06    2019-11-24 Methods are created to make the calculator compatible with Units.
